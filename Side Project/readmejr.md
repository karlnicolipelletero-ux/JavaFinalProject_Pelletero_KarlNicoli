_**Project Description**_

This project started as a simple preset calculator. Over time, I expanded its functionality by adding several additional features, including:

•Delete key for correcting input

•ANS (previous answer) functionality

•Square root operation

•Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)

•Inverse trigonometric functions (asin, acos, atan)

•A more organized and cleaner button layout for better usability

This is a small side project that I’m continuously improving, and I decided to upload it here as part of my personal learning and development.
